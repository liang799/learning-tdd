Learning TDD by reading the book: TDD by Example

## Procedure
1. Write a test
2. Make it compile
3. Run it to see that it fails
4. Make it run
5. Remove duplication

First 3 steps prioritise speed over quality

## Key findings
- Divide and conquer (small steps)
- Passing tests very quickly is more important than code quality
- After passing the tests, then clean up the code

## Techniques
- **Fake it:**  If something goes wrong
- **Obvious implementation:**  When all is well
- **Triangulation:** adding another test case and generalize the 2 cases when uncertain on how to refactor
